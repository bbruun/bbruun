- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a GNU/Linux System Administrator that ventured into GNU/Linux back in '98 and still loving it
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in system administration (oddly enough) and Kubernetes, and SBC (Single Board Computers) like Udoo/Pi etc. and motorcycles (you gotta live near the edge some of the time)
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... a new things every day, it is kind of a motto for me `Learn one new thing every day no matter what it is`
- ğŸ“« How to reach me - just ping me here.
